# Around the World in 10 GIFs...

_Around the World in 10 GIFs_ allows you to visit cities around the world via GIFs. Merely click on the button displaying the city name you wish to visit, and ten GIFs will load on the page. Then click the GIF to animate it, and click again to turn off animation. 

Don't see the city you want to visit? Add your own button to see GIFs from that city!  

# Why The Project Is Useful

The project was designed to teach us how to work with and manipulate APIs. I also found it useful because it was the first project where I dynamically created divs to display information, both in a general sense -- to push the GIFs themselves to the DOM -- and also in terms of displaying them on the page. We had already seen most of the coding in class exercises before starting the homework, but that didn't make it any less challenging, but it did give us a perspective on how the individual parts work (dynamically creating buttons, AJAX GETs, etc.) before we began to put them together.  

I again used Bootstrap for the design, which allowed me to ensure the mobile friendliness of the site while being able to draw upon predetermined layouts to get the GIFs on the page. I find that using Bootstrap to lay out my page, as challenging as it can be to properly code each element (divs, containers, columns, etc.), allows me to focus most of time on functionning code that is written as DRYly as possible without getting hung up on design.
